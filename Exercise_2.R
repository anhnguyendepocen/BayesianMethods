# Exercise 2 

# Please refer to Exercise_2.pdf for a more detailed description of this exercise and more framed breakdown of questions and tasks.

# TASK A)
# in a beta-binomial model of allele frequencies, we observe 40 derived alleles (k=40) out of 200 chromosomes (n=200),
# plot the posterior distribution assuming a uniform (beta) prior.
# calculate some notable quantiles

# TASK B)
# as in Task A, but assuming we have only 20 chromosomes (10 individuals), so k=4 and n=20

# TASK C)
# as in Task A, but using an informative prior. Use a suitable form for the beta distribution that may fit the expected distribution of allele frequencies.

# TASK D)
# as in Task C, with informative prior but with only 20 chromosomes (10 individuals), so k=4 and n=20

# OPTIONAL TASK E)
# as in Task C, perform a model choice between the cases of the frequency of T<0.1 and the frequency of T>=0.1
# use a uniform prior, an informative prior as in Tasks C-D, and a skeptical prior
# calculate Bayes factors
